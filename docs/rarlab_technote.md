## Data types

### vint
Variable length integer. Can include one or more bytes, where lower 7 bits of every byte contain integer data and highest bit in every byte is the continuation flag. If highest bit is 0, this is the last byte in sequence. So first byte contains 7 least significant bits of integer and continuation flag. Second byte, if present, contains next 7 bits and so on.

Currently RAR format uses vint to store up to 64 bit integers, resulting in 10 bytes maximum. This value may be increased in the future if necessary for some reason.

Sometimes RAR needs to pre-allocate space for vint before knowing its exact value. In such situation it can allocate more space than really necessary and then fill several leading bytes with 0x80 hexadecimal, which means 0 with continuation flag set.

### byte, uint16, uint32, uint64
Byte, 16-, 32-, 64- bit unsigned integer in little endian format.

### Variable length data
We use ellipsis ... to denote variable length data areas.

### Hexadecimal values
We use 0x prefix to define hexadecimal values, such as 0xf000

## General archive structure

### General archive block format

| Field | Size | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Header CRC32 | uint32 | CRC32 of header data starting from *Header size* field and up to and including the optional extra area. |
| Header size | vint | Size of header data starting from *Header type* field and up to and including the optional extra area. This field must not be longer than 3 bytes in current implementation, resulting in 2 MB maximum header size. |
| Header type | vint | Type of archive header. Possible values are:<br>1 — Main archive header.<br>2 — File header.<br>3 — Service header.<br>4 — Archive encryption header.<br>5 — End of archive header. |
| Header flags | vint | Flags common for all headers:<br>0x0001 — Extra area is present in the end of header.<br>0x0002 — Data area is present in the end of header.<br>0x0004 — Blocks with unknown type and this flag must be skipped when updating an archive.<br>0x0008 — Data area is continuing from previous volume.<br>0x0010 — Data area is continuing in next volume.<br>0x0020 — Block depends on preceding file block.<br>0x0040 — Preserve a child block if host block is modified. |
| Extra area size | vint | Size of extra area. Optional field, present only if 0x0001 header flag is set. |
| Data size | vint | Size of data area. Optional field, present only if 0x0002 header flag is set. |
| ... | ... | Fields specific for current block type. See concrete block types description for details. |
| Extra area | ... | Optional area containing additional header fields, present only if 0x0001 header flag is set. |
| Data area | vint | Optional data area, present only if 0x0002 header flag is set. Used to store large data amounts, such as compressed file data. Not counted in *Header CRC* and *Header size* fields. |

### General extra area format
Extra area can include one or more records having the following format:

| Field | Size | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Size | vint | Size of record data starting from *Type*. |
| Type | vint | Record type. Different archive blocks have different associated extra area record types. Read the concrete archive block description for details. New record types can be added in the future, so unknown record types need to be skipped without interrupting an operation. |
| Data | ... | Record dependent data. May be missing if record consists only from size and type. |

### General archive layout
```
Self-extracting module (optional)
RAR 5.0 signature
Archive encryption header (optional)
Main archive header
Archive comment service header (optional)

File header 1
Service headers (NTFS ACL, streams, etc.) for preceding file (optional).
...
File header N
Service headers (NTFS ACL, streams, etc.) for preceding file (optional).

Recovery record (optional).
End of archive header.
```

## Archive blocks

### Self-extracting module (SFX)
Any data preceding the archive signature. Self-extracting module size and contents is not defined. At the moment of writing this documentation RAR assumes the maximum SFX module size to not exceed 1 MB, but this value can be increased in the future.

### RAR 5.0 signature
RAR 5.0 signature consists of 8 bytes:
0x52 0x61 0x72 0x21 0x1A 0x07 0x01 0x00.
You need to search for this signature in supposed archive from beginning and up to maximum SFX module size.
Just for comparison this is RAR 4.x 7 byte length signature:
0x52 0x61 0x72 0x21 0x1A 0x07 0x00.

### Archive encryption header

| Field | Size | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Header CRC32 | uint32 | |
| Header size | vint | |
| Header type | vint | 4 |
| Header flags | vint | Flags common for all headers |
| Encryption version | vint | Version of encryption algorithm. Now only 0 version (AES-256) is supported. |
| Encryption flags | vint | 0x0001 — Password check data is present. |
| KDF count | 1 byte | Binary logarithm of iteration number for PBKDF2 function. RAR can refuse to process KDF count exceeding some threshold. Concrete value of threshold is a version dependent. |
| Salt | 16 bytes | Salt value used globally for all encrypted archive headers. |
| Check value | 12 bytes | Value used to verify the password validity. Present only if 0x0001 encryption flag is set. First 8 bytes are calculated using additional PBKDF2 rounds, 4 last bytes is the additional checksum. Together with the standard header CRC32 we have 64 bit checksum to reliably verify this field integrity and distinguish invalid password and damaged data. Further details can be found in UnRAR source code. |

This header is present only in archives with encrypted headers. Every next header after this one is started from 16 byte AES-256 initialization vector followed by encrypted header data. Size of encrypted header data block is aligned to 16 byte boundary.

### Main archive header

| Field | Size | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Header CRC32 | uint32 | |
| Header size | vint | |
| Header type | vint | 1 |
| Header flags | vint | Flags common for all headers |
| Extra area size | vint | Size of extra area. Optional field, present only if 0x0001 header flag is set. |
| Archive flags | vint | 0x0001 — Volume. Archive is a part of multivolume set.<br>0x0002 — Volume number field is present. This flag is present in all volumes except first.<br>0x0004 — Solid archive.<br>0x0008 — Recovery record is present.<br>0x0010 — Locked archive. |
| Volume number | vint | Optional field, present only if 0x0002 archive flag is set. Not present for first volume, 1 for second volume, 2 for third and so on. |
| Extra area | ... | Optional area containing additional header fields, present only if 0x0001 header flag is set. |

Extra area of main archive header can contain following record types

| Type | Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0x01 | Locator | Contains positions of different service blocks, so they can be accessed quickly, without scanning the entire archive. This record is optional. If it is missing, it is still necessary to scan the entire archive to verify presence of service blocks. |
| 0x02 | Metadata | Optional record storing archive metadata, which includes archive original name and time. |

#### Locator record

| Field | Size | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Size | vint | |
| Type | vint | 1 |
| Flags | vint | 0x0001 — Quick open record offset is present.<br>0x0002 — Recovery record offset is present. |
| Quick open offset | vint | Distance from beginning of quick open service block to beginning of main archive header. Present only if 0x0001 flag is set. If equal to 0, should be ignored. It can be set to zero if preallocated space was not enough to store the resulting offset. |
| Recovery record offset | vint | Distance from beginning of recovery record service block to beginning of main archive header. Present only if 0x0002 flag is set. If equal to 0, should be ignored. It can be set to zero if preallocated space was not enough to store the resulting offset. |

#### Metadata record

| Field | Size | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Size | vint | |
| Type | vint | 2 |
| Flags | vint | 0x0001 — Archive name is present.<br>0x0002 — Archive original creation time is present.<br>0x0004 — Use Unix time if 1, Windows FILETIME if 0.<br>0x0008 — Defines Unix time as nanoseconds since 1970-01-01 if 1 and as seconds since 1970-01-01 if 0. |
| Name length | vint | Original archive name length. Present if flag 0x0001 is set. |
| Name | ? bytes | Variable length field containing *Name length* bytes of original archive name in UTF-8 format. Present if flag 0x0001 is set. In general the trailing zero is missing, but if name length is changed while archiving, one or more trailing zeroes can be present as result of size overprovisioning. In this case the name shall be truncated at the first trailing zero. Typically it happens in the first volume in multivolume set. In rare case if initially reserved buffer size is not enough to store the resulting name, the first byte of this buffer is set to zero. It indicates that no name is stored even if its length is set to non-zero. |
| Time | 4 or 8 bytes | Original archive creation time either in 8 bytes Windows FILETIME format if flag 0x0004 is 0, or in Unix format if 0x0004 is 1. Unix format can be 4 bytes seconds since 1970-01-01 if flag 0x0008 is 0 or 8 bytes nanoseconds since 1970-01-01 if 0x0008 is 1. |

### File header and service header
These two header types use the similar data structure, so we describe them both here.

| Field | Size | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Header CRC32 | uint32 | |
| Header size | vint | |
| Header type | vint | 2 for file header, 3 for service header |
| Header flags | vint | Flags common for all headers |
| Extra area size | vint | Size of extra area. Optional field, present only if 0x0001 header flag is set. |
| Data size | vint | Size of data area. Optional field, present only if 0x0002 header flag is set. For file header this field contains the packed file size. |
| File flags | vint | Flags specific for these header types:<br>0x0001 — Directory file system object (file header only).<br>0x0002 — Time field in Unix format is present.<br>0x0004 — CRC32 field is present.<br>0x0008 — Unpacked size is unknown.<br>If flag 0x0008 is set, unpacked size field is still present, but must be ignored and extraction must be performed until reaching the end of compression stream. This flag can be set if actual file size is larger than reported by OS or if file size is unknown such as for all volumes except last when archiving from stdin to multivolume archive. |
| Unpacked size | vint | Unpacked file or service data size. |
| Attributes | vint | Operating system specific file attributes in case of file header. Might be either used for data specific needs or just reserved and set to 0 for service header. |
| mtime | uint32 | File modification time in Unix time format. Optional, present if 0x0002 file flag is set. |
| Data CRC32 | uint32 | CRC32 of unpacked file or service data. For files split between volumes it contains CRC32 of file packed data contained in current volume for all file parts except the last. Optional, present if 0x0004 file flag is set. |
| Compression information | vint | Lower 6 bits (0x003f mask) contain the version of compression algorithm, resulting in possible 0 - 63 values. Currently values 0 and 1 are possible. Version 0 archives can be unpacked by RAR 5.0 and newer. Version 1 archives can be unpacked by RAR 7.0 and newer.<br>7th bit (0x0040) defines the solid flag. If it is set, RAR continues to use the compression dictionary left after processing preceding files. It can be set only for file headers and is never set for service headers.<br>Bits 8 - 10 (0x0380 mask) define the compression method. Currently only values 0 - 5 are used. 0 means no compression.<br>Bits 11 - 15 (0x7c00) specify the minimum dictionary size required to extract data. If we define these bits as N, the dictionary size is 128 KB * 2^N. So value 0 means 128 KB, 1 - 256 KB, ..., 15 - 4096 MB, ..., 19 - 64 GB. 23 means 1 TB, which is the theoretical maximum allowed by this field. Actual compression and decompression implementation might have a lower limit. Values above 15 are used only if compression algorithm version is 1.<br>Bits 16 - 20 (0xf8000) are present only if version of compression algorithm is 1. Value in these bits is multiplied to the dictionary size in bits 11 - 15 and divided by 32, the result is added to dictionary size. It allows to specify up to 31 intermediate dictionary sizes between neighbouring power of 2 values.<br>Bit 21 (0x100000) is present only if version of compression algorithm is 1. It indicates that even though the dictionary size flags are in version 1 format, the actual compression algorithm is version 0. It is helpful when we append version 1 files to existing version 0 solid stream and need to increase the dictionary size for version 0 files not touching their compressed data. |
| Host OS | vint | Type of operating system used to create the archive.<br>0x0000 — Windows.<br>0x0001 — Unix. |
| Name length | vint | File or service header name length. |
| Name | ? bytes | Variable length field containing *Name length* bytes in UTF-8 format without trailing zero. For file header this is a name of archived file. Forward slash character is used as the path separator both for Unix and Windows names. Backslashes are treated as a part of name for Unix names and as invalid character for Windows file names. Type of name is defined by *Host OS* field. If Unix file name contains any high ASCII characters which cannot be correctly converted to Unicode and UTF-8, we map such characters to 0xE080 - 0xE0FF private use Unicode area and insert 0xFFFE Unicode non-character to resulting string to indicate that it contains mapped characters, which need to be converted back when extracting. Concrete position of 0xFFFE is not defined, we need to search the entire string for it. Such mapped names are not portable and can be correctly unpacked only on the same system where they were created. For service header this field contains a name of service header. Now the following names are used:<br>CMT — Archive comment<br>QO — Archive quick open data<br>ACL — NTFS file permissions<br>STM — NTFS alternate data stream<br>RR — Recovery record |
| Extra area | ... | Optional area containing additional header fields, present only if 0x0001 header flag is set. |
| Data area | vint | Optional data area, present only if 0x0002 header flag is set. Store file data in case of file header or service data for service header. Depending on the compression method value in *Compression information* can be either uncompressed (compression method 0) or compressed. |

File and service headers use the same types of extra area records:

| Type | Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0x01 | File encryption | File encryption information. |
| 0x02 | File hash | File data hash. |
| 0x03 | File time | File creation, modification and last access time. |
| 0x04 | File version | Information about file versioning. |
| 0x05 | Redirection | Information about file system redirection (symbolic links, etc.). |
| 0x06 | Unix owner | Information about Unix user and group owners. |
| 0x07 | Service data | Additional service data for service header. |

#### File encryption record

| Field | Size | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Size | vint | |
| Type | vint | 0x01 |
| Version | vint | Version of encryption algorithm. Now only 0 version (AES-256) is supported. |
| Flags | vint | 0x0001 — Password check data is present.<br>0x0002 — Use tweaked checksums instead of plain checksums. If flag 0x0002 is present, RAR transforms the checksum preserving file or service data integrity, so it becomes dependent on encryption key. It makes guessing file contents based on checksum impossible. It affects both data CRC32 in file header and checksums in file hash record in extra area. |
| KDF count | 1 byte | Binary logarithm of iteration number for PBKDF2 function. RAR can refuse to process KDF count exceeding some threshold. Concrete value of threshold is version dependent. |
| Salt | 16 bytes | Salt value to set the decryption key for encrypted file. |
| IV | 16 bytes | AES-256 initialization vector. |
| Check value | 12 bytes | Value used to verify the password validity. Present only if 0x0001 encryption flag is set. First 8 bytes are calculated using additional PBKDF2 rounds, 4 last bytes is the additional checksum. Together with the standard header CRC32 we have 64 bit checksum to reliably verify this field integrity and distinguish invalid password and damaged data. Further details can be found in UnRAR source code. |

#### File hash record
Only the standard CRC32 checksum can be stored directly in file header. If other hash is used, it is stored in this extra area record:

| Field | Size | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Size | vint | |
| Type | vint | 0x02 |
| Hash type | vint | 0x00 — BLAKE2sp hash function. |
| Hash data | ? bytes | 32 bytes of BLAKE2sp for 0x00 hash type. For files split between volumes it contains a hash of file packed data contained in current volume for all file parts except the last. For files not split between volumes and for last parts of split files it contains an unpacked data hash. |

#### File time record
This record is used if it is necessary to store creation and last access time or if 1 second precision of Unix mtime stored in file header is not enough:

| Field | Size | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Size | vint | |
| Type | vint | 0x03 |
| Flags | vint | 0x0001 — Time is stored in Unix time_t format if this flags is set and in Windows FILETIME format otherwise<br>0x0002 — Modification time is present<br>0x0004 — Creation time is present<br>0x0008 — Last access time is present<br>0x0010 — Unix time format with nanosecond precision |
| mtime | uint32 or uint64| Modification time. Present if 0x0002 flag is set. Depending on 0x0001 flag can be in Unix time_t or Windows FILETIME format. |
| ctime | uint32 or uint64| Creation time. Present if 0x0004 flag is set. Depending on 0x0001 flag can be in Unix time_t or Windows FILETIME format. |
| atime | uint32 or uint64| Last access time. Present if 0x0008 flag is set. Depending on 0x0001 flag can be in Unix time_t or Windows FILETIME format. |

If flag 0x0010 is set, Unix time format is 8 byte nanoseconds since 1970-01-01. Otherwise it is 4 byte seconds since 1970-01-01. Windows FILETIME always uses 8 byte format.

#### File version record

| Field | Size | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Size | vint | |
| Type | vint | 0x04 |
| Flags | vint | Reserved, set to 0. |
| Version | vint | File version number. |

#### File system redirection record

| Field | Size | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Size | vint | |
| Type | vint | 0x05 |
| Type | vint | 1 — Unix symbolic link.<br>2 — Windows symbolic link.<br>3 — Windows junction.<br>4 — Hard link.<br>5 — Unused in RAR. |
| Flags | vint | 0x0001 — Link target is a directory. |
| Name length | vint | Link target name length. |
| Name | ? bytes | Link target name, UTF-8 encoded, without trailing zero. |

#### Unix owner record

| Field | Size | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Size | vint | |
| Type | vint | 0x06 |
| Flags | vint | 0x0001 — User name is present.<br>0x0002 — Group name is present.<br>0x0004 — Numeric user ID is present.<br>0x0008 — Numeric group ID is present. |
| User length | vint | User name length. Present if 0x0001 is set. |
| User name | ? bytes | User name string (UTF-8, no trailing zero). Present if 0x0001 is set. |
| Group length | vint | Group name length. Present if 0x0002 is set. |
| Group name | ? bytes | Group name string (UTF-8, no trailing zero). Present if 0x000 группа is set. |
| User ID | vint | Numeric user ID. Present if 0x0004 is set. |
| Group ID | vint | Numeric group ID. Present if 0x0008 is set. |

#### Service data record

| Field | Size | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Size | vint | |
| Type | vint | 0x07 |
| Data | ... | Service data specific for service header name. |

### End of archive header

| Field | Size | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Header CRC32 | uint32 | |
| Header size | vint | |
| Header type | vint | 5 |
| Header flags | vint | Flags common for all headers |
| End flags | vint | 0x0001 — Next volume is present. |

## Service headers

Service headers are similar to file headers, having Header type 3 and often using same record types in extra area. Their data area contains service information.

### Archive comment header
It is a service header with name "CMT". Comment text is stored in header data area. Compression method in *Compression information* is set to 0, though we might allow compression here in the future.

### Quick open header
It is a service header with name "QO". It contains copies of file headers to speed up archive opening. This header is optional. Its data area contains a list of archive blocks in the same format as they are stored in the archive. Each block is preceded by vint value containing offset relative to previous block in quick open data. Offset to first block is zero.
