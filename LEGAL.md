# Legal and Provenance Notes

## Clean-Room Policy for UnRAR References

This project does not include copied UnRAR implementation code in `raze-src`.
UnRAR may be consulted as a behavioral reference during compatibility testing.

UnRAR license terms include restrictions around re-creating the proprietary RAR
compression algorithm. Keep this project focused on decompression behavior and
independent implementation.

If you distribute UnRAR source or binaries together with this project, include
the original UnRAR license text and comply with all of its notice requirements.
